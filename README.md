# Local Admin Panel — WYSIWYG editor for index.html

This small tool serves your site and provides a WYSIWYG admin at `/admin` that lets you edit the page visually and save changes to `index.html`.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run locally:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open admin UI: http://localhost:3000/admin

Notes:
- A backup of `index.html` is created when you save (filename shown after save).
- This is a local development tool. Do not expose it to the public without adding authentication.
